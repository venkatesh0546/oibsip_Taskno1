            <h2 >PLAY <span>LIST</span></h2>  
            <p>Playlists are collections of songs grouped together
                based on a theme, genre, mood, or occasion. They’re 
                curated by MY Music’s in-house editorial team or 
                independent music curators who update them regularly. 
                Playlists can have tens of thousands of followers, 
                and getting your music added to one could open doors 
                to new fan bases and revenue streams.
